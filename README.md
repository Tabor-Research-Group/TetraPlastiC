# TetraPlastiC

This is a github repo for 
1. Plastic crystal dataset and not plastic crystal dataset
2. Training classification models for determining plastic crystal or not (All_data_prediction/classification)
3. Training regression models for Plastic crystal (All_data_prediction/regression)

Detail methodologies are described in DOI:
All the trainings except for the linear regression use SISSO (DOI:10.1103/PhysRevMaterials.2.083802) to screen the available descriptors.
